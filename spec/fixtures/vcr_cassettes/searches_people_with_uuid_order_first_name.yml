        which he started in his college dorm room in 2004 with roomates Dustin Moskovitz
        and Chris Hughes and from New York.\r\n\r\nZuckerberg is responsible for setting
        the overall direction and product strategy for the company. He leads the design
        of Facebook''s service and development of its core technology and infrastructure.
        Mark studied computer science at Harvard University before moving the company
        to Palo Alto, California.\r\n\r\nEarlier in life, Zuckerberg developed a music
        recommendation system called Synapse and a peer-to-peer client called Wirehog.
        However, he abandoned both to pursue new projects.\r\n\r\nZuckerberg attended
        Harvard University and studied computer science before founding Facebook.\r\n\r\nWhile
        at Harvard, Zuckerberg created Facemash, a website that compared students''
        dorm photos side-by-side in a fashion similar to HOT or NOT. Harvard administration
        was not amused, and Zuckerberg faced subsequent disciplinary action. Less
        than three months later, he launched Facebook.\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, Zuckerberg
        donated $100 million to the Newark Public School System to help renovate and
        revamp the system.\r\n\r\nZuckerberg won the 2007 Crunchie Award for ''Best
        Startup CEO.'' He was the Time Magazine 2010 Person Of The Year. He also won
